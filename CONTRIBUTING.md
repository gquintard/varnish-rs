# Testing

There are two types of tests in this project:

### `trybuild` tests
[trybuild](https://docs.rs/trybuild/latest/trybuild/) tests, which verify that the macro code can be compiled, or when there is a problem, the compiler errors are properly reported. The test cases are in the `varnish/tests` -- `pass/*.rs` work by default, `pass-ffi/*.rs` work only with the `ffi` feature is enabled, and `fail/*.rs` should fail. The expected errors are in the `fail/*.stderr` files. To update the expected output, run `just bless`.

### `insta` tests
[insta](https://insta.rs/docs/cli/) tests, which verify that the macros produce the correct output when used correctly, and also that the output is stable. The test uses the same `pass` and `pass-ffi` files, and the expected output is in the `varnish/snapshots/*.snap` files. The test runner must be part of the crate itself due to it being proc-macro, so it is located in `varnish-macros/src/tests.rs`. To update the snapshots, use the same `just bless` command. Make sure to install insta first.

### Debugging Macro-Generated Code

The simplest way to observe generated code is to examine `varnish/sanshots/*@code.snap` files. They contain code generated from the `varnish/test/pass/*.rs` files. Additionally, the model file describes intermediate parse result of the test file, json files shows the data given to the Varnish vmod compiler, and docs contain the generated documentation. 

For a more in-depth look, use `cargo expand` command.  You will need to run `cargo install cargo-expand` to install it first. You can copy/paste the expanded code into the same file, removing some boilerplate before and after the expanded code, and then run `cargo check` to see the errors.  Note that some expansions cannot be compiled - e.g. anything expanded from `format!` or `panic!` - so you may need compare the generated code with the original, and keep all the original parts for anything unrelated to the generated code.

Note that the test cases in `varnish/tests` will not work with cargo expand unless you make it part of the regular compilation. For example, let's say we want to debug `varnish/test/pass/object.rs`.  Modify `varnish/tests/compiler.rs` like this:

```rust
#[path = "pass/object.rs"]
mod try_to_build;
```

Once you have done that, you can run the following command to save generated code to a file:

```shell
cargo expand -p varnish --test compile --tests try_to_build > varnish/tests/pass/object.expanded.rs
```

Delete the top 2 lines with `mod try_to_build {` and the last `}`,  and reformat `object.expanded.rs`  before comparing it with `object.rs` to see the resulting code.  Now, modify the `path` in the `compiler.rs` to point to the expanded file, and you should be able to run `cargo check --tests` to see the errors.
