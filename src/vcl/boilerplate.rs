//! The boilerplate code generated by `vmodtool-rs.py` uses C types, which are
//! defined in `varnish_sys`. To avoid requiring this crate as a build
//! dependency, we reexport the handful of types we need here.
//!
//! From a vmod point of view, you'll probably never only need those. You'll be
//! able to ignore them completely and use the `rust` equivalents, or you'll
//! need to tap into `varnish_sys` directly.
