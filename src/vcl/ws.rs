//! Store data in a task-centric store to share with the C layers
//!
//! The workspace is a memory allocator with a simple API that allows Varnish to store data that
//! needs only to live for the lifetime of a task (handling a client or backend request for example).
//! At the end of the task, the workspace is wiped, simplifying memory management.
//!
//! Rust handles its own memory, but some data must be shared/returned to the C caller, and the
//! workspace is usually the easiest store available.
//!
//! **Note:** unless you know what you are doing, you should probably just use the automatic type
//! conversion provided by [`crate::vcl::convert`], or store things in
//! [`crate::vcl::vpriv::VPriv`].
