# Varnish Module (VMOD) `vdp`

Manipulate `resp.body`

Varnish Delivery Processors allow a vmod writer to insert themselves into a delivery
pipeline and alter an object body as it is being delivered to a client.  In this vmod,
the transformation is very simple: we simply send the body backwards using a delivery
processor (VDP) named "flipper".

```vcl
// Place import statement at the top of your VCL file
// This loads vmod from a standard location
import vdp;

// Or load vmod from a specific file
import vdp from "path/to/libvdp.so";
```
