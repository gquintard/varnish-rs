# Varnish Module (VMOD) `object`

A simple string dictionary in your VCL

```vcl
// Place import statement at the top of your VCL file
// This loads vmod from a standard location
import object;

// Or load vmod from a specific file
import object from "path/to/libobject.so";
```

### Constructor `object.kv([INT cap])`

Create a new key-value store, with an optional capacity.
If `cap` is 0 or less, it will be ignored.

#### Method `STRING <object>.get(STRING key)`

Retrieve the value associated `key`, or an empty string if `key` didn't exist.

There is currently an inefficiency in the implementation: when found, the value
is a `&str`, so it must be converted to a `String` to be returned, which is then
copied into an internal Varnish workspace. In the future, we will provide a way
to avoid this double-copy.

#### Method `VOID <object>.set(STRING key, STRING value)`

Insert a key-value pair into the store.

Note that varnish-accessible functions use readonly `&self`,
so the interior mutability pattern should be used to store data.
