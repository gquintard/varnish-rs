# Varnish Module (VMOD) `vfp`

Manipulate `resp.body`

Varnish Fetch Processors allow a vmod writer to insert themselves into a delivery
pipeline and alter an object body as it is being received from the backend.
In this vmod, we simply lowercase the ascii letters using a VFP named "lower".

```vcl
// Place import statement at the top of your VCL file
// This loads vmod from a standard location
import vfp;

// Or load vmod from a specific file
import vfp from "path/to/libvfp.so";
```
