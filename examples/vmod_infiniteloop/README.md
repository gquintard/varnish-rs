# Varnish Module (VMOD) `infiniteloop`

Ignore the restart/retry limits

```vcl
// Place import statement at the top of your VCL file
// This loads vmod from a standard location
import infiniteloop;

// Or load vmod from a specific file
import infiniteloop from "path/to/libinfiniteloop.so";
```

### Function `VOID reset()`

Set the `retries` and `restarts` internal counters to 0.
This is extremely dangerous, and you only use this if you know what you are doing,
and/or love infinite loops.

#### Safety
this function is unsafe from the varnish point of view, doing away with
important safeguards, but it's also unsafe in the rust way: it dereferences
pointers which may lead nowhere
