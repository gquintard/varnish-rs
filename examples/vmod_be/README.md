# Varnish Module (VMOD) `be`

a simple STRING dictionary in your VCL

```vcl
// Place import statement at the top of your VCL file
// This loads vmod from a standard location
import be;

// Or load vmod from a specific file
import be from "path/to/libbe.so";
```

### Constructor `be.parrot(STRING to_repeat)`

parrot is our VCL object, which just holds a rust Backend,
it only needs two functions:
- `new()`, so that the VCL can instantiate it
- `backend()`, so that we can produce a C pointer for varnish to use

#### Method `BACKEND <object>.backend()`
